# PyTerm
PyTerm is a basic Python3 based shell that runs in only 1 file, and is meant to stay that way until it needs to change.
PyTerm is a side-project of mine that I'll be working on, if I'm not focusing on Teal in that moment.

# Platforms
PyTerm runs best on Linux, but some commands also support Windows, macOS and FreeBSD.

# How to run
You can install PyTerm by just downloading the file and running it wherever you're able to on your computer.

# Startup Guide
PyTerm will look for a `startup.ptp` file on startup, and if it exists, it will run it.
You can use this to set initial default variables for your usual workflow.
